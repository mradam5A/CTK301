		These specific projects I did in a AP art class! The theme was 1970s music <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="#DDD5F3" class="bi bi-suit-heart-fill" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

		This project is named Not Forgotten. It represents the time where rock band members in the 1970s were an iconic inspiration to many people today. And even though they might be dead, people still look up to them and won't forget them. The hands reaching for the body means they inspire to be like them and still reach out to them for inspiration. I did the head a skull to represent death and the rest of the body alive representing that these iconic figures will always live on.</p>

   <p > This Project is named Join Me. It is a man reaching out of the TV toward the viewer. Music videos were simple back then with just some colors in the back so I put that in this drawing. I wanted it to feel like the singer was asking "come dance and sing with me" because most music videos would express that. </p>

		This Project is named Subz Laundry. During the 1970s laundromats were very commonly used by many people. I wanted to include something that people went to a lot so picked that as my location. The designs were very colorful because I wanted it to seem like the music from the beatbox was lighting everything up.

    <p >  This Project is named Vivid Tunes. I was inspired by the cultural Pop Art. Pop Art was so colorful and bright and had such unique designs. I made a Pop Art kind of look for the background and used lots of circles on purpose for the simplicity.  I added more and put a speaker and a guy looking at the album cover. The album cover is something random I drew from looking at other covers during that time.  </p>

   <p > This Project is named Alive. Music has lots of emotion, memories,and culture within it. Music also grows and changes during time as well, so that's why in this drawing I made a guitar with flowers growing out of it. Then chose to make it black and white besides the flowers to make them be the focal point.</p>

    <p > This Project is named Dancing Tonight. It was popular for people to go out to a disco. At Discos, people would wear very vibrant clothes and dance all night. I included a walkman in the picture because they were commonly used to listen to music wherever they went. His stance was an iconic disco dance move and thought that it brought energy and movement to the drawing.</p>
