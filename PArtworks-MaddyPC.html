		These specific projects I did in a AP art class! The theme was 1970s music <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="#DDD5F3" class="bi bi-suit-heart-fill" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

    <p >  This project is named Not Forgotten. It represent the time where rock bands members in the 1970s were such an inspiration to many people today and even though they might be dead people still look up to them and wont forget them. The hands reaching for the body means they inspire to be like them and keep them in mind, I did the head dead and the rest alive because the skull represents death while the rest of the body is still alive.</p>

   <p >  This Project is named Join me. Its supposed to be a man reaching out of the tv toward the viewer. Music videos were simple back then with just some colors in the back so i put that in this drawing. I wanted it to feel like the singer was asking "come dance and sing with me" because most music videos would express that. </p>

    <p >  This Project is named Vivd Tunes. I did this from inspiration of popart. They were so colorful and birght and such unqiue designs. I made a popart kind of look for the background. Then I wanted to add more so put a speaker and a guy looking in a album. The album is something random I drew from looking at other albums during that time.  </p>
