	   <h2>About Me!</h2>

		<p > Hi my name is Maddy. Im a student at Illionios State unviversity studying to be a visual desginer. What I do is make digital art and hope to countinue doing that up to a job. Somethings about me is that im currently 19 years old. What made me get into digital art is my love of drawing, videogames, and technology. Videogames have been a huge part in my life and inspired me to start drawing digitaly with how cool everything looks when its been edited. I want to make designs for companies and help them make their product look good and help them sell whatever they are making using all of my experience I have learned.  </p>
